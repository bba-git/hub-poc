# Common Cursor Prompts for HPV PoC (Supabase)

This file contains reusable prompts for guiding Cursor when working on the HPV Platform Proof of Concept.
Always prefer TDD (Test-Driven Development) and refer to `tasks.md`, `technical.md`, and `.cursorcontext.md`.

---

## 🛠️ 1. Start a Service with TDD
```plaintext
Implement [TASK_ID]: Apply TDD.
- Write unit tests first for the service (spec.ts file).
- Then implement the service to pass tests.
- Mock all external dependencies (SupabaseClient, AuditLogService).
- Follow DTO and validation rules.
- Update docs/status.md after tests are passing.
Reference: tasks/tasks.md for requirements.
```

---

## 📡 2. Create a Controller with Validation
```plaintext
Create a Controller for [ModuleName]:
- Map endpoints based on tasks/tasks.md.
- Validate input using DTOs (class-validator).
- Apply HttpException for errors.
- Structure response formats consistently.
- Respect folder structure in src/[module]/.
```

---

## 🛡️ 3. Add a Guard for Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
```plaintext
Implement a Guard for RBAC:
- Use Reflector to retrieve role metadata.
- Restrict access based on user.role.
- Throw ForbiddenException if role mismatch.
- Place guard inside src/[module]/guards/.
- Write unit tests for the guard.
```

---

## 🧪 4. Write Unit Tests First (TDD Reminder)
```plaintext
MANDATORY: Before implementing code:
- Create spec.ts test files.
- Cover success and failure cases.
- Mock external services.
- Only proceed to implementation after tests are written.
```

---

## 📈 5. Update Status after Completing a Task
```plaintext
After completing a task:
- Update docs/status.md:
  - Mark task as Completed
  - List which acceptance criteria were covered
  - Mention any blockers or decisions taken
```

---

## 🔄 6. Deployment Note Prompts
```plaintext
Prepare deployment notes:
- Document environment variables required (e.g., SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_KEY).
- Describe how to run migrations if any.
- Indicate endpoints exposed (auth/login, appointment/create, etc.).
- Mention any Supabase RLS policies activated.
```

---

# ✅ Notes
- Always read .cursorrules for architectural and technical constraints.
- Always apply TDD unless stated otherwise.
- Always validate inputs (security critical for production).

Good prompting = clean Cursor results 🚀
